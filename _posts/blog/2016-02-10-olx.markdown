<h2>OLX teams up with MVBC</h2>

<p>OLX.co.za is running a charity campaign whereby OLX staff will be buying 2nd hand gym equipment to donate to Montevideo Primary School's new sports facility. Therefore I would like to request and encourage the basketball community to download the app or use the OLX website to place ads to sell all unused gym equipment and tools then OLX staff members will come and pay you cash for it. Each staff member will only receive R500 budget to buy with so please consider this when pricing your items. Its a perfect way to make extra cash while making equipment available for OLX to donate to the community. You can sell anything from skipping ropes, punching bags, tension bands, various weights, dumbbels, workout bench, gym mats etc etc.</p>

<p>By selling and making money, you are contributing.</p>

<p>Please share with friends and organizations who you know can benefit from selling unwanted gym and sports equipment.</p>
