        <title>MVBC Camp 2014!</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Junior MVBC Camp 2014&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/pics/camp1-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;camp pic&quot; class=&quot;fluid-c&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Montana Vikings Basketball Club’s (MVBC) Junior Camp is an important opportunity for us to positively influence the daily decision-making and life-style choices of our juniors away from the basketball court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept originated by trying to find solutions to some of the many socio-economic challenges we face as a club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Junior Camp encourages our members from different demographics, social and cultural backgrounds to be together for a weekend, sharing life experiences, and learning from and with each other. Our club members come from a wide range of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. Areas include Montana, Valhalla Park, Gugulethu, Nyanga, Heideveld, Manenberg, Phillipi as well as Grassy Park, Goodwood, Salt River, Rondebosch, Blouberg and Brackenfell. One of the main reasons for our club’s success is that we are a family, and we provide the home away from home environment to our members. The integration allows the less fortunate members with particularly financial difficulties to identify opportunities and to rise above their challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rely a great deal on donations sourced from our club community and their networks to help maintain the success of this all important Annual Junior Camp and therefore appeal for your contributions towards our event. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Maloti - the REAL MVP!!!</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Maloti wins the MVP of the tournament&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/pics/8G-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8Gs Pic 2&quot; class=&quot;fluid-l&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Sivuyile &quot;Maloti&quot; Qavane, for being awarded the tournament MVP. Proving a thorn in the sides of all the teams we came up against, Maloti really used this tournament as his coming out party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets hope this fine form can carry on into the CTBA league, as well as his further development at BNL level.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MVBC win it all</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;MVBC take the 8 thousand rand and the title!!!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Montana Vikings Basketball Club surged to victory in the inaugural Cape Basketball Championship on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vikings, a juggernaut in Cape basketball, lost just one game throughout the tournament to claim the trophy and R8000 in cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/pics/8G-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8Gs Pic 1&quot; class=&quot;fluid-l&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Championship started at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) Cape Town campus with pool matches on Saturday. Vikings were drawn in Pool B along with CPUT Cats and CPUT Alumni, while Pool A comprised Constantia-based Hurricanes Basketball Club, the University of Cape Town (UCT) and the University of the Western Cape (UWC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vikings got their title charge going with a narrow 67-63 win over Cats before losing 54-51 to Alumni to finish second in their group, while Cats placed first. In Group A Hurricanes beat UWC 64-60 and UCT 64-38 to finish on top, while UWC finished second after beating UCT 66-48 in their other game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the scores and results from the group stages proved a poor reflection of the teams involved, as both the group winners were eliminated in the semi-finals. Hurricanes lost 72-50 to Vikings, while Cats were beaten 84-66 by UWC. Cats went on to beat Hurricanes 77-70 in the third-place play-off to claim the bronze medal. And Vikings took all the spoils after beating UWC 80-75 in the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final of the women&amp;rsquo;s tournament finished with the CPUT Cats first and second teams battling it out for superiority. Both teams went into the final undefeated, finishing at the summit of their respective groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cats second team topped Pool A after defeating UCT 54-30 and Lethal Ladies 57-37, while Lethal Ladies were second after beating UCT 60-22. The Cats first team beat UWC 62-49 and Vikings 43-38, and Vikings finished second in the group after beating UWC 65-41 in their other match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first team dominated their semi-final fixture against Lethal Ladies, winning 68-38, while the second side scraped to a 49-45 win over Vikings. The Vikings women&amp;rsquo;s team could not emulate their men&amp;rsquo;s team by taking home a medal and lost 64-42 to Lethal Ladies in the third-place play-off. In the end, the CPUT first team were too strong and beat the second team 62-44 to take home the R8000 in cash and the trophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual tournament was hosted by Platinum Media Group.&lt;/p&gt;
