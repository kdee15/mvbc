        <title>Have you ever tried to play basketball in the dark?</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Have you ever tried to play basketball in the dark?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you’ve ever played for Vikings, you know what I’m talking about!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mvbc.co.za/assets/images/blog/pics/play-in-the-dark.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Play In The Dark&quot; class=&quot;fluid-c&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the old days at Montevideo Primary School when we practiced outdoors, in the cold and even in the rain? Well, some things just don’t change!  But some things have. Bread costs more and so does everything else. Rising electricity costs have had a major impact on all of us and MVBC needs to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter is a cold and dark time but MVBC is a beacon of light in many children’s lives. And who are we kidding - not only the kids, but for many of our seniors too. We have academic support sessions in the classrooms in the afternoon and evening, as well as our practices on the court where we need those floodlights to be on.. Not only to actually see each other (and the ball!) but also for our member’s safety. The new school hall has a small gym section where some of our members work out on their off days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;That&#39;s why MVBC needs your help right now!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a small donation of R100 per month over a period of 12 months, all we need is 20 sponsors to keep the lights on. Commit to this small donation and you’ll be making a HUGE difference. Please use the reference: ‘Alumni’ with your donation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contact Kirk Daniels @ 082 377 9991 or Tanya Daniels @ 082 5225 978 for more information and to let us know if you&#39;ll be 1 of the 20 donors we need.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MVBC 24 Hour Basketball Marathon 2016!</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;24 Hour Basketball Marathon 2016&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Montana Vikings Basketball Club (MVBC) 24 Hour Basketball Marathon is an event where all members of the club get together to participate in basketball themed activities continuously for 24 hours. The idea behind the event was to create an environment where the entire club could get together and do the thing we love most – play basketball. Throughout the course of the event members from across all age groups team up to compete for 20 minute periods, resulting in scenarios where under 12 girls end up sharing the court with players from our senior men’s teams. Due to the fact that this event focuses more on the fun aspect than the winning, these moments become quite special for our juniors who aspire to become great basketball players one day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MVBC, we use every club event to deliver a positive message, and impart valuable life skills to our juniors. These are in the form of social awareness sessions, talks from our seniors about their life experiences, and sessions from external community organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event has grown tremendously since its inception in 2000, and with a club membership of 120 active players, along with parents, friends and non-playing members, we have been able to generate hype around the event. In 2012 and 2013 &amp;amp; 2016 KFM covered the event, and in the past we’ve had Hectic99 presenters covering it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MVBC Camp 2015</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Junior MVBC Camp 2015&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mvbc.co.za/assets/images/blog/pics/camp15-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;camp pic&quot; class=&quot;fluid-c&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year&#39;s camp will take on a different spin - as being in December, it will have a bit of a Christmas theme. Also, we are being adventurous, and taking on a 4 - 5hr trip to get there!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Koekenaap Cultural Centre&lt;/b&gt; is situated on the northern banks of the fertile Olifants River Valley between Vredendal and Lutzville. It was established in 1966 and is housed in a disused old farm school and is surrounded by vineyards close to the scenic environment of the flowers of Namakwaland. This facility is fully accessible for physically challenged people and caters mostly for the rural communities on the West Coast Region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, we rely a great deal on donations sourced from our club community and their networks to help maintain the success of this all important Annual Junior Camp and therefore appeal for your contributions towards our event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mvbc.co.za/assets/images/blog/pics/camp1-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;camp pic&quot; class=&quot;fluid-c&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Montana Vikings Basketball Club’s (MVBC) Junior Camp is an important opportunity for us to positively influence the daily decision-making and life-style choices of our juniors away from the basketball court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept originated by trying to find solutions to some of the many socio-economic challenges we face as a club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Junior Camp encourages our members from different demographics, social and cultural backgrounds to be together for a weekend, sharing life experiences, and learning from and with each other. Our club members come from a wide range of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. Areas include Montana, Valhalla Park, Gugulethu, Nyanga, Heideveld, Manenberg, Phillipi as well as Grassy Park, Goodwood, Salt River, Rondebosch, Blouberg and Brackenfell. One of the main reasons for our club’s success is that we are a family, and we provide the home away from home environment to our members. The integration allows the less fortunate members with particularly financial difficulties to identify opportunities and to rise above their challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rely a great deal on donations sourced from our club community and their networks to help maintain the success of this all important Annual Junior Camp and therefore appeal for your contributions towards our event. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MVBC win it all</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;MVBC take the 8 thousand rand and the title!!!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Montana Vikings Basketball Club surged to victory in the inaugural Cape Basketball Championship on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vikings, a juggernaut in Cape basketball, lost just one game throughout the tournament to claim the trophy and R8000 in cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mvbc.co.za/assets/images/blog/pics/8G-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8Gs Pic 1&quot; class=&quot;fluid-l&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Championship started at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) Cape Town campus with pool matches on Saturday. Vikings were drawn in Pool B along with CPUT Cats and CPUT Alumni, while Pool A comprised Constantia-based Hurricanes Basketball Club, the University of Cape Town (UCT) and the University of the Western Cape (UWC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vikings got their title charge going with a narrow 67-63 win over Cats before losing 54-51 to Alumni to finish second in their group, while Cats placed first. In Group A Hurricanes beat UWC 64-60 and UCT 64-38 to finish on top, while UWC finished second after beating UCT 66-48 in their other game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the scores and results from the group stages proved a poor reflection of the teams involved, as both the group winners were eliminated in the semi-finals. Hurricanes lost 72-50 to Vikings, while Cats were beaten 84-66 by UWC. Cats went on to beat Hurricanes 77-70 in the third-place play-off to claim the bronze medal. And Vikings took all the spoils after beating UWC 80-75 in the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final of the women&amp;rsquo;s tournament finished with the CPUT Cats first and second teams battling it out for superiority. Both teams went into the final undefeated, finishing at the summit of their respective groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cats second team topped Pool A after defeating UCT 54-30 and Lethal Ladies 57-37, while Lethal Ladies were second after beating UCT 60-22. The Cats first team beat UWC 62-49 and Vikings 43-38, and Vikings finished second in the group after beating UWC 65-41 in their other match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first team dominated their semi-final fixture against Lethal Ladies, winning 68-38, while the second side scraped to a 49-45 win over Vikings. The Vikings women&amp;rsquo;s team could not emulate their men&amp;rsquo;s team by taking home a medal and lost 64-42 to Lethal Ladies in the third-place play-off. In the end, the CPUT first team were too strong and beat the second team 62-44 to take home the R8000 in cash and the trophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual tournament was hosted by Platinum Media Group.&lt;/p&gt;
