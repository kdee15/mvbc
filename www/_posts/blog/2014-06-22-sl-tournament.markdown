<h2>MVBC take the 8 thousand rand and the title!!!</h2>

<p>The Championship started at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) Cape Town campus with pool matches on Saturday. Vikings were drawn in Pool B along with CPUT Cats and CPUT Alumni, while Pool A comprised Constantia-based Hurricanes Basketball Club, the University of Cape Town (UCT) and the University of the Western Cape (UWC).</p>
<p>Vikings got their title charge going with a narrow 67-63 win over Cats before losing 54-51 to Alumni to finish second in their group, while Cats placed first. In Group A Hurricanes beat UWC 64-60 and UCT 64-38 to finish on top, while UWC finished second after beating UCT 66-48 in their other game.</p>
<p>But the scores and results from the group stages proved a poor reflection of the teams involved, as both the group winners were eliminated in the semi-finals. Hurricanes lost 72-50 to Vikings, while Cats were beaten 84-66 by UWC. Cats went on to beat Hurricanes 77-70 in the third-place play-off to claim the bronze medal. And Vikings took all the spoils after beating UWC 80-75 in the final.</p>
<p>The final of the women&rsquo;s tournament finished with the CPUT Cats first and second teams battling it out for superiority. Both teams went into the final undefeated, finishing at the summit of their respective groups.</p>
<p>The Cats second team topped Pool A after defeating UCT 54-30 and Lethal Ladies 57-37, while Lethal Ladies were second after beating UCT 60-22. The Cats first team beat UWC 62-49 and Vikings 43-38, and Vikings finished second in the group after beating UWC 65-41 in their other match.</p>
<p>The first team dominated their semi-final fixture against Lethal Ladies, winning 68-38, while the second side scraped to a 49-45 win over Vikings. The Vikings women&rsquo;s team could not emulate their men&rsquo;s team by taking home a medal and lost 64-42 to Lethal Ladies in the third-place play-off. In the end, the CPUT first team were too strong and beat the second team 62-44 to take home the R8000 in cash and the trophy.</p>
<p>The annual tournament was hosted by Platinum Media Group.</p>
