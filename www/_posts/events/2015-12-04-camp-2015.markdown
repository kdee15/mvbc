<h2>Junior MVBC Camp 2015</h2>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/pics/camp15-1.jpg" alt="camp pic" class="fluid-c">

<p>This year's camp will take on a different spin - as being in December, it will have a bit of a Christmas theme. Also, we are being adventurous, and taking on a 4 - 5hr trip to get there!!!</p>
<p><b>Koekenaap Cultural Centre</b> is situated on the northern banks of the fertile Olifants River Valley between Vredendal and Lutzville. It was established in 1966 and is housed in a disused old farm school and is surrounded by vineyards close to the scenic environment of the flowers of Namakwaland. This facility is fully accessible for physically challenged people and caters mostly for the rural communities on the West Coast Region.</p>


<p>As always, we rely a great deal on donations sourced from our club community and their networks to help maintain the success of this all important Annual Junior Camp and therefore appeal for your contributions towards our event. </p>
